# Financial Tracker Project (AWS)
This project showcases a personal cloud project I did using AWS. The primary focus of this project was to understand as many AWS services as possible to create a financial tracking application. I used a CI/CD pipeline on the frontend of the application. The majority of frontend coding for this project was from a template, allowing the implementation of cloud services to still be the main focus.
## Services
Lambda, API Gateway, AWS Amplify, CloudWatch, DynamoDB, and IAM were the key services used in this project. Below, I  have included an architectural diagram used to create this app.
