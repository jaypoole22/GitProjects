# Financial Tracker Project (AWSüöÄ)
 This project showcases a personal cloud project I did using AWS. The primary focus of this project was to include as many AWS services as possible to create a financial tracking application. I used a CI/CD pipeline on the frontend of the application. The majority of the frontend coding for this project was based on a template, allowing the implementation of cloud services to remain the main focus.
## Servicesüíª
- AWS Amplify (CI/CD Deployment)
- API Gateway (Routing & integration)        
- DynamoDB (NoSQL storage for expenses and budgets)
- AWS Lambda (Data processing & analysis)
- Lambda Function URL (Directly called from frontend)
- CloudWatch (Optional monitoring/logging)
- IAM

Every service in this architectural diagram serves a key purpose. AWS Amplify provides a CI/CD pipeline that connects the frontend code in GitHub to Amplify Hosting, ensuring automatic builds and deployments. Amplify sets up the backend by linking API Gateway with Lambda so requests from the app can reach your backend code, enabling secure routing and execution of application logic. Lambda processes incoming requests and interacts with DynamoDB, which stores data in a scalable NoSQL format. Finally, CloudWatch monitors logs, metrics, and traffic across all interconnected services to maintain reliability and performance.
